# Kevin Cartwright's Aftereffects Scripts
19/07/2017

These are some Aftereffects scripts I am working on.

I am a video artist living in Wellington NZ.

Feel free to use these scripts if they are useful to you, this is Open Source Project
under an MIT License.

# myScript1.jsx
Basic starting place for scripting projects in Adobe Aftereffects CC 2017.
So far this script creates a new Project, and starts a 640x480 composition.
A solid layer is added with RGB color from an array variable.
